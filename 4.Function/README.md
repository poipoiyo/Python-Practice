## Homework
Based on previous homework, you might have a team to develop the same product.
It is better to assign jobs to your teamates.
For example, John can handle ladder case, and May can handle tree case.
Use function to help your assignment.

### For example : 
Your program should support the same input/output as previous homework.
Besides, you should also support a wider version.

- Input: `Give a wide level 5 ladder.`
- Output:
```
1-1
2-22
3-333
4-4444
5-55555
```

- Input: `Give me wide level 5 V.`
- Output:
```
55       55
 44     44
  33   33
