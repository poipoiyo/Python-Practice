# Loop

## Homework 1
Customer always request weird things, which may or may not be supported by your product.

### For example : 
- Input: `Give a level 5 ladder.`
- Output:
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```
- Input: `Give me a level 5 tree.`
- Output:
- Note: level can only be odd(3, 5, 7, 9) for tree product
```
    1
   222
  33333
 4444444
555555555
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
```
- Input: `Give me level 5 V.`
- Output:
```
5       5
 4     4
  3   3 
   2 2 
    1
``` 
- Input: `Give me level 5 lion`
- Output: `Sorry, we don't support that.`

- Level will be limited from 1 to 9.

## Homework 2
Sometimes you might understand the logic first and make it as a program then.

### For example
- Input: `Give me a level 5 special matrix.`
- Output:
```
[
    [1, 3, 8, 20, 48],
    [0, 2, 5, 12, 28],
    [0, 0, 3,  7, 16],
    [0, 0, 0,  4,  9],
    [0, 0, 0,  0,  5]
]
```

## Optional
How if the customer wants more loops, and it is hard to simplify that.
Is there a better way to do that?

### For example
- Input: `Give me level 5 snake with 4 corners.`
- Output:
```
5       5       5    
 4     4 4     4 4   
  3   3   3   3   3  
   2 2     2 2     2 
    1       1       1
```
