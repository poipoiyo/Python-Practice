# Loop

## Homework
Customer always request weird things, which may or may not be supported by your product.

### For example : 
- Input: `Give a level 5 ladder.`
- Output:
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```
- Input: `Give me a level 5 tree.`
- Output:
```
    1
   222
  33333
 4444444
555555555
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
```
- Input: `Give me level 5 V.`
- Output:
```
5       5
 4     4
  3   3 
   2 2 
    1
``` 
- Input: `Give me level 5 lion`
- Output: `Sorry, we don't support that.`

- Level will be limited from 1 to 9.

### Optional:
There is a rule in this matrix, and you should understand that and make it as a program.

- Input: `Give me a level 5 special matrix.`
- Output:
```
[
    [1, 3, 8, 20, 48],
    [0, 2, 5, 12, 28],
    [0, 0, 3,  7, 16],
    [0, 0, 0,  4,  9],
    [0, 0, 0,  0,  5]
]
```
